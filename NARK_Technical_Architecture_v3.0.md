Abstract
We develop a first-principles, verifiable architecture for an ocean-deployed energy harvester that couples an actively controlled resonant kinetic subsystem to wave excitation, with a baseline generator (nuclear or electrical surrogate) providing control authority and steady export. We explicitly eliminate non-physical assumptions (no energy multiplication; no infinite-Q), adopt the optimality condition for absorbed power in linear wave theory (complex-conjugate control), and construct a mechanical-electrical-control architecture that can realize this condition under bounded actuation and state limits. We further place the system inside a controlled, isolated hydrodynamic environment (“closed-basin facility”) that holds orientation constant and constrains boundary conditions, thereby turning a poorly conditioned identification-and-control problem into a reproducible, instrumented one where performance can be demonstrated against the correct physical bounds. The result is a conceptual blueprint that is long on derivations, definitions, interfaces, and acceptance procedures, and short on generalities: designers can implement the proposed control and electromechanics and evaluate the system without ambiguity.
We make five contributions: (1) a physically consistent problem statement using radiation–diffraction hydrodynamics and capture-width constraints; (2) a control law and implementation path that realize complex-conjugate impedance with passivity guarantees and bounded control power; (3) a mechanical layout and power-electronic interface that render the control law implementable with linear permanent-magnet generators and active magnetic bearings (no cryogenics); (4) a facility-level configuration that fixes orientation and allows enforceable wave spectra, enabling unequivocal validation; (5) a staged verification plan with falsifiable performance metrics tied to first principles. All claims are stated as hypotheses with explicit pass/fail criteria.
Introduction
1.1 Motivation and boundary conditions
Ocean wave energy is abundant but stochastic. Practical devices face a dual difficulty: (i) hydrodynamic coupling varies with sea state; (ii) control actions that increase amplitude must not violate energy conservation or introduce hidden energy injection. A correct architecture respects deep-water wave power flux and capture-width bounds; control can only shape impedance to approach those bounds.
This manuscript designs a system that makes such a demonstration possible in practice by: (a) using a controlled basin with defined wave spectra; (b) enforcing orientation constancy and clear mechanical isolation from any baseline generator; (c) implementing a provably optimal (in the linear regime) control target that is passive by construction; and (d) using a mechanical-electromechanical stack that renders the control implementable and measurable.
1.2 Non-claims and scope
We do not claim energy creation, self-multiplication, or capture beyond the wave-power bound. We do not assume superconducting bearings or frictionless devices at sea. We do not integrate a nuclear reactor in early stages; we model the baseline generator as a DC source with finite isolation and losses.
Background and theoretical frame
2.1 Wave power and capture width
For deep water, the wave power flux per unit crest length J(ω) admits the form J ≈ (ρ g^2 / 64π) Hs^2 Te at the spectrum level (Hs significant height, Te energy period; expressions vary with spectral definition). For an axisymmetric point absorber with characteristic width W, time-averaged absorbed power Pabs is bounded: Pabs ≤ Cw J W, where 0 ≤ Cw ≤ 1 (in ideal theory); practical Cw values for good devices are typically below ≈0.6. Any architecture that claims more violates energy conservation or miscounts inputs.
2.2 Linear hydrodynamics and the SDOF reduction
Using radiation–diffraction theory, a heave-mode point absorber can be reduced about a dominant mode to the time-domain equation (Cummins formulation, truncated to a linear SDOF with radiation effects lumped):
mA ẍ(t) + ∫0t Krad(τ) ẋ(t − τ) dτ + Khydro x(t) = Fexc(t) + Fctrl(t)
Under narrowband or control bandwidth assumptions, the convolution term can be replaced by an equivalent radiation damping Brad(ω) ẋ; we then obtain
mA ẍ + (Brad + Bint) ẋ + (Khydro + Kint) x = Fexc + Fctrl
Bint, Kint represent internal losses and stiffness contributions. The absorbed power is the average rate at which Fexc and Fctrl do work and is bounded by the wave input. The optimality condition below assumes these linearizations are valid near the operating point.
2.3 Optimal absorption via complex-conjugate control
For harmonic excitation at frequency ω, define total stiffness Ktot = Khydro + Kctrl and total damping Btot = Brad + Bint + Bctrl. The steady-state absorbed power from the wave field into the device (converted by the alternator) is maximized when
Ktot = mA ω^2 and Bctrl = Brad
i.e., tuning on resonance and matching radiation damping (complex-conjugate impedance). The corresponding absorbed power satisfies
Pabs,max(ω) = |Fexc(ω)|^2 / (8 Brad)
subject to actuator and stroke limits. This is a widely accepted result in wave energy control theory; our contribution is to realize it with a passive-equivalent controller and an implementable electromechanical platform.
Architecture overview
3.1 Facility-level configuration (controlled basin with enforced orientation)
We place the device in a closed or semi-closed basin with:
Programmable wave makers generating target spectra Sη(ω) (Pierson–Moskowitz, JONSWAP, and controlled narrowband sets).
Orientation enforcement via a low-friction overhead gimbal or torsionally compliant mooring that holds yaw constant relative to the wave probes while allowing heave and limited surge/sway; this isolates confounding rotational degrees of freedom without injecting mechanical energy (only constraint forces).
Boundary damping to minimize reflections and enable longer stationarity windows.
Environmental logging (pressure arrays, wave probes, PIV as available) aligning excitation estimates with measured device response.
This controlled environment is not cosmetic—it is the enabler for reproducible identification of Fexc(ω), Brad(ω) and for verifying whether the control law approaches the theoretical bound without unaccounted inputs.
3.2 Mechanical and electromechanical stack
Primary mode: heave internal reaction mass moving along a linear guide within the hull. The hull responds to waves; the internal mass moves relative to the hull, exchanging momentum through the alternator.
Guidance: active magnetic bearings (AMB) or low-loss flexures for axial guidance. AMBs avoid sliding friction and allow stiffness shaping; they introduce manageable control overhead.
Transduction/actuation: a direct-drive linear permanent-magnet (PM) alternator providing both energy conversion and controlled electromagnetic force. With appropriate power electronics, the alternator implements velocity-proportional forces (damping) and small position-proportional forces (virtual stiffness) near the operating point. This unifies actuation and generation and makes the complex-conjugate target implementable with one device.
Isolation: any baseline generator (nuclear surrogate) is mechanically isolated from the heave assembly by a low-pass support structure; coupling is purely electrical via a DC bus. There are no through-hull shafts; magnetic or electrical coupling only.
3.3 Electrical architecture
DC bus: aggregates alternator output and baseline generator; includes energy storage (capacitive plus battery) for reactive exchanges and transient control power.
Inverter: exports AC as needed; grid-interface requirements are outside this manuscript’s immediate scope.
Protection: independent isolation for baseline power, alternator, and control supply; fail-safe shunts for overvoltage during braking.
Control synthesis
4.1 Implementable control law
We design control to emulate target mechanical impedance Zctrl(ω) such that
Kctrl(ω0) = mA ω0^2 − Khydro and Bctrl(ω0) = Brad(ω0)
for a chosen ω0 tracked against the dominant spectral peak. In time domain:
Fctrl(t) = −Kctrl x(t) − Bctrl ẋ(t) + fNL(t)
where fNL(t) are bounded nonlinear terms for saturation, anti-windup, and robustness (Section 4.3).
Implementation with a linear alternator:
Electromagnetic force Fem ≈ kf i, where kf is force constant and i is coil current (sign conventions chosen consistently).
Damping emulation: set current proportional to ẋ (i = α ẋ); then Fem ∝ ẋ implements Bctrl. Power generated by this action is routed to the DC bus; resistive losses are accounted explicitly.
Stiffness emulation: around the operating point, a small position-proportional force can be implemented via current bias or auxiliary fields; practically we minimize Kctrl by hull shaping and leave Kctrl to fine trimming, not large ranges.
4.2 Passivity and control power bound
Define the device storage function V = 0.5 mA ẋ^2 + 0.5 Ktot x^2. Under Fctrl = −Kctrl x − Bctrl ẋ and Bctrl ≥ 0, the rate of change obeys
V̇ = ẋ (Fexc − (Brad + Bint + Bctrl) ẋ)
= ẋ Fexc − (Brad + Bint + Bctrl) ẋ^2
Time-averaged over stationary excitation, the control term reduces energy in the mechanical mode; the alternator harvests a portion of (Brad + Bctrl) ẋ^2 subject to conversion losses. The control power drawn from the DC bus is dominated by reactive shaping and losses in the actuation electronics; by construction, we do not inject sustained active power (no negative damping). We enforce a design constraint:
Pctrl,avg ≤ ε Pabs,avg with ε ∈ [0.05, 0.10]
by limiting the reactive term magnitude and bandwidth and using energy storage to buffer transients.
4.3 Broadband adaptation and robust implementation
Spectral adaptation: estimate Sη(ω) online via short-time spectral analysis; choose ω0(t) as the dominant frequency and update Brad(ω0) via a reduced-order hydrodynamic model calibrated offline (radiation–diffraction computations + system identification).
Gain scheduling: gains (Kctrl, Bctrl) are updated with bumpless transfer and hysteresis to prevent chatter. State and input constraints enforce |x| ≤ Xmax, |ẋ| ≤ Vmax, |i| ≤ Imax. Anti-windup ensures passivity under saturation.
Observers: velocity from filtered differentiation of position or via co-located velocity sensors; position from linear encoders/inductive sensors. Sensor fusion reduces bias.
Stability margins: we use small-gain or Lyapunov analysis to select gain bounds ensuring closed-loop stability under model uncertainty and bounded disturbances.
Hydrodynamic modeling and identification
5.1 Radiation–diffraction model and reduced-order forms
We compute frequency response functions (FRFs) for excitation force Fe(ω), added mass mA(ω), radiation damping Brad(ω), and hydrostatic stiffness Khydro using a boundary-element method (e.g., Nemoh/WEC-Sim). We then fit parametric forms:
mA(ω) ≈ mA0 + ∑l ml ω^2/(ω^2 + al^2)
Brad(ω) ≈ ∑l bl ω^2/(ω^2 + cl^2)
Khydro assumed constant near the operating band (small variations absorbed by Kctrl).
These reduced-order models (ROMs) provide fast evaluation onboard and are used to synthesize target gains.
5.2 Facility-specific identification
The controlled basin allows direct measurement of transfer functions, validation of ROMs, and estimation of site-specific corrections (e.g., reflections, mooring effects). We perform swept-sine and random-phase multisines to identify deviations and adjust controllers accordingly.
Mechanical design details (implementable choices)
6.1 Internal reaction mass and guidance
Mass: choose m so that the heave resonance of the internal mass–hull system can be tuned across the dominant basin test frequencies without large Kctrl. Larger m increases stored energy but raises structural demands and actuator requirements.
Guidance: AMBs provide axial stiffness Kamb and bias currents that set load capacity; position sensors inside the bearing control loop achieve sub-millimeter precision. Flexures can provide passive backup stiffness and fail-safe centering.
6.2 Linear alternator
Force constant kf sized to realize Bctrl ranges at the maximum expected velocity Vmax without exceeding current Imax. Slotless stator reduces cogging and hysteresis losses. Laminated cores and low-loss conductors minimize eddy currents.
Thermal management via conduction paths to the hull; coupling to seawater heat sink through isolation layers is analyzed.
6.3 Hull and mooring
Axisymmetric hull optimized for heave response; internal rails integrate with structural bulkheads.
Mooring to hold yaw while allowing heave; stiffness selected to avoid coupling unintended modes into the control band.
Electrical and power electronics
DC bus: rated for alternator power + control transients + baseline source; includes storage (supercapacitors + battery) sized for settling-time demands.
Power converters: bidirectional current control for the alternator; ensures four-quadrant operation for damping and energy conversion. Inverter feeding shore/grid loads kept out of the control bandwidth.
Protection and isolation: ground fault detection, DC bus overvoltage clamps, fail-safe dumps during emergency braking.
Verification in a controlled basin (unambiguous tests)
8.1 Why the basin matters
By fixing orientation, bounding reflections, and enforcing known spectra, the basin removes major confounds and converts the question “does the architecture work?” into measurable quantities: absorbed power relative to the theoretical bound and relative to passive baselines, with control overhead accounted explicitly.
8.2 Experimental procedures and pass/fail criteria
We define four graded tests; each has metrics tied to derived bounds.
Test A: Narrowband optimality
Excitation: quasi-monochromatic waves at frequency ω0.
Objective: demonstrate Pabs(ω0) within [0.8, 1.0] × Pabs,max(ω0) subject to actuator and stroke limits.
Procedure: measure Fe(ω0) via pressure arrays and infer Brad(ω0) from ROM/ID; compute Pabs,max; run ARC and record Pabs; compare with bound and with a passive controller of equal structural mass.
Acceptance: Pabs ≥ 0.8 Pabs,max; Pctrl,avg ≤ 0.1 Pabs,avg; no instability or constraint violation.
Test B: Broadband sea spectra
Excitation: JONSWAP/Pierson–Moskowitz with given Hs, Te.
Objective: maximize ∫ Pabs(ω) dω; show significant improvement over passive baseline and adherence to capture-width constraints.
Procedure: run ARC with spectral adaptation; compute time-averaged Pabs and compare to (i) passive baseline and (ii) theoretical integral of pointwise Pabs,max masked by actuator/constraint limits.
Acceptance: ≥20–40% improvement over passive (value depends on hull and spectra), adherence to capture-width bound, Pctrl,avg ≤ 0.1 Pabs,avg.
Test C: Disturbance and saturation robustness
Excitation: step changes in dominant frequency and amplitude; injected sensor noise; actuator current limits.
Objective: maintain passivity and safe operation; graceful degradation (controller falls back to dissipative damping).
Acceptance: no instability; energy balance remains consistent; logs show bounded control action.
Test D: Energy accounting closure
Objective: close the power balance over long windows.
Measurement: alternator electrical output; control converter input; resistive and core losses; DC bus storage variation; hydrodynamic excitation estimates.
Acceptance: Pexport = Psalvaged − Pctrl − Ploss ± δ, with δ within metering uncertainty. No hidden energy sources.
Uncertainty, limits, and failure modes
Model uncertainty: ROM fits have bounded error; controller gains include margins (gain/phase) validated experimentally.
Structural limits: stroke and velocity envelopes enforced; AMB failure triggers passive damping and eddy-current brakes.
Sea-state extrapolation: basin demonstrations do not guarantee survivability in storms; structural design for operational seas only at this stage.
No nuclear integration: the baseline generator in the basin is an electrical surrogate; nuclear aspects require separate safety and licensing work.
Scaling and arrays (conceptual only)
Multi-core within a hull: orthogonal mechanical modes (e.g., distinct axes or nested guides) tuned to different bands; electrical summation at the DC bus; cross-coupling minimized by control bandwidth separation.
Arrays: layout optimization to manage constructive/destructive interference; outside scope of this manuscript.

Conclusion
We have constructed a physically consistent, implementable architecture for a nuclear-augmented (baseline-powered), resonant kinetic wave energy harvester and placed it into a controlled basin configuration that makes performance unambiguous and reproducible. The key is not exotic mechanics; it is correct control and correct accounting. By (i) targeting the complex-conjugate optimum, (ii) realizing it with a passive-equivalent damping law and a linear alternator that both actuates and harvests, (iii) using a controlled environment to fix orientation and spectra, and (iv) enforcing explicit power balances and bounds, we convert a speculative idea into a set of tests whose success would legitimately demonstrate feasibility. If the tests fail, the diagnostics are precise: mismatch in Brad identification, actuator saturation, excessive losses, or control fragility. If they pass, we have a credible new instrument in the wave-energy toolkit: not a claim to unlimited power, but a disciplined method to approach what physics permits.

Appendix B: Derivation of pointwise optimal absorbed power
Assuming harmonic excitation Fexc = Re{F̂ e^{jωt}} and steady-state displacement x = Re{X̂ e^{jωt}}, with impedance Ztot(ω) = Ktot − mA ω^2 + j ω (Brad + Bint + Bctrl), the average absorbed power into damping channels is
Pabs = 0.5 ω^2 |X̂|^2 (Brad + Bctrl)
and |X̂| = |F̂|/|Ztot|. Maximize Pabs with respect to Ktot and Bctrl; set ∂Pabs/∂Ktot = 0 and ∂Pabs/∂Bctrl = 0; obtain Ktot = mA ω^2 and Bctrl = Brad. Substitution gives:
Pabs,max = |F̂|^2 / (8 Brad)
subject to state and actuation limits. This is the target for Test A (narrowband).
Appendix C: Passivity condition for damping control via a linear alternator
Let Fem = kf i, and converter set i = α ẋ. Electrical power into the converter is Pel = vi, where v is back EMF plus converter-driven voltage. Under energy-conserving modeling, v ≈ ke ẋ plus converter control voltage. If α is chosen such that Pel ≤ 0 on average (generator mode dominating), then Bctrl = −kf α / ω has sign ensuring dissipation; passivity holds provided the converter losses are bounded and no net active power is injected on average.
